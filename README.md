  ## Hi there 👋

  I am a junior **SwiftUI Software Engineer** working on a e-commerce app.
  
  **Finance**, **banking** and **investments** are my captivations. Thus, to deepen my knolege on stocks analysis, I decided to take a bachelor's degree in CS. Ultimately, my favourite subjects have been `databases` and `machine learning`.<br>
